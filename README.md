This project includes my python implementations for the algorithms taught in the Algorithms course by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. The link to the course is here: https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/


This project is divided into 3 folders:

- Fundaments: Includes basic/fundamental algorithms that cover Binary Search, Knuth's Shuffle, Union Find, and Deque (Stack and Queue).

- Sorting: Covers several classic sorting algorithms including selection-sort, insertion-sort, shell-sort, merge-sort, and binary-heap-sort.

- Searching: Covers several classic sorting and serching algorithms like bineary search tree, and red-black BST.


Here is a cheatsheet providing all the formulas and their performance characteristics: https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/cheatsheet/
